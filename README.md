### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an IT student at KIIT University.

I started programming when I was in class 7. I wish to work in a FANG company in future. I work with tech which excites me. I am a Machine Learning Engineer as well as Android Developer. I love to play with API. From collecting to data till deploying it in AWS/Heroku is my job. I love my job :)
My job is also to do complex things in a simple way.
